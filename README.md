# End-to-End-Data-Analytics-Project-Python-SQL

This project talks about a full data analytics pipleine using Jupyter Notebook for inteeractive development. The tools used in this are Python, Pandas and MySQL to move from raw data to structed dataset

Tools:

Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation
Pandas for data preprocessing and transformation
Kaggle API to download the dataset programmatically
MySQL for structured data storage
mysql-connector-python for transferring data to MySQL

Workflow
1.Data Download
Fetched data from Kaggle using the Kaggle API directly within the notebook.

2.Data Processing
Cleaned, explored, and reshaped data using Pandas.

3.Database Integration
Connected to a local MySQL instance and inserted cleaned data using mysql.connector.

Outcome:
A clean dataset loaded into MySQL, ready for SQL queries and analytics, all managed from a single Jupyter Notebook.
